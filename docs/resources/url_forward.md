## Schema

### Required

- `domain` (String) The domain name for which to configure URL forwarding (e.g., example.com).
- `include_path` (Boolean) When set to true, paths will be preserved in the forwarding. For example, requests to 'www.example.com/page.html' will be forwarded to 'destination.com/page.html'.
- `location` (String) The destination URL for the forward. Must be a fully qualified URL including the protocol (e.g., https://destination.com).
- `type` (String) The type of forward: 'temporary' (HTTP 302) or 'permanent' (HTTP 301).
- `wildcard` (Boolean) When set to true, enables wildcard forwarding. This allows the forward to match any subdomain not explicitly defined by another forward record.

### Optional

- `subdomain` (String) The subdomain to forward. Leave empty for the apex domain. Use '*' for wildcard forwarding when combined with the wildcard option.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the URL forward. Automatically generated by Porkbun.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import porkbun_url_forward.example <domain>/<forward_id>
```
