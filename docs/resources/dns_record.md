## Schema

### Required

- `content` (String) The content of the DNS record. Format depends on the record type (e.g., IP address for A records, target domain for CNAME records).
- `domain` (String) The domain name for which to create the DNS record (e.g., example.com).
- `subdomain` (String) The subdomain for the record being created, not including the domain itself. Use an empty string for the apex domain.
- `type` (String) The type of DNS record to create (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT, NS, ALIAS, SRV, TLSA, CAA, HTTPS, SVCB).

### Optional

- `prio` (Number) The priority for the DNS record. Only used for certain record types like MX and SRV. Default is 0.
- `ttl` (Number) The Time To Live (TTL) for the DNS record in seconds. Minimum value is 600 seconds (10 minutes). Default is 600.

### Read-Only

- `id` (Number) The ID of the DNS record. This is assigned by Porkbun and used for record management.
